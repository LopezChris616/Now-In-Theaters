## Now In Theaters

Now In Theaters is an application that allows you to view what movies are currently in theaters, as well as, view what movies will be released in the coming weeks. It allows you to be redirected to Fandango to purchase tickets if you so choose. It also allows you to search for any movie you would like and it will return the results of your search to the page.
